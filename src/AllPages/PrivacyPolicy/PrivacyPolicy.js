            All information is stored through a data management system. Practice takes
            precautions to protect Personal Information. When customers submit Personal
            Information via the Website, it is protected both online and offline. Whenever
            Practice collects sensitive Personal Information (such as credit card data), that
            information is encrypted and transmitted to Practice in a secure way. Customers
            can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of their web
            browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>

          <p className={styles.para}>While Practice uses encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,
            we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the
            information to perform a specific job (for example, customer service) are granted
            access to Personal Information. The computers and servers in which we store
            Personal Information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

          <p className={styles.para}>However, unfortunately, please note that no data transmission over the Internet or
            any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we
            strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (a) there are
            security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b)
            the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged

          <p className={styles.para}>All Personal Information collected by Practice will be held in confidentiality and
            will not be disclosed to third parties, except that we may disclose Personal
            Information: (1) pursuant to the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy, (2)
            if we are required to do so by law, (3) in the good-faith belief that such action is
            necessary to conform to the edicts of the law, (4) to comply with legal process
